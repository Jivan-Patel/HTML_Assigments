    <h1> Keep Moving Forward </h1>
<cite><blockquote>
Life isn’t always a straight road. Sometimes it feels like you’re climbing uphill with no end in sight, and other times it feels like you’re stuck in the same place while everyone else is moving ahead. But here’s the truth—progress is progress, no matter how small.

The secret to growth isn’t about making giant leaps every day. It’s about showing up, being consistent, and refusing to quit when things get hard. Success is built on small steps that stack up over time. Even when you feel tired or unmotivated, pushing yourself a little further each day makes a huge difference.

Remember, failure is not the opposite of success—it’s part of the process. Every mistake teaches you something new, every setback makes you tougher, and every challenge shapes you into a stronger version of yourself.

So whenever you feel like giving up, remind yourself why you started. Focus on your goals, trust your journey, and keep moving forward. Because one day, the struggles you’re facing right now will be the story of how you made it.
