<h2>Rise</h2>

<pre>
    The sun wakes up, the sky turns gold,
    A brand new story waits, untold.
    Dreams may be heavy, roads may be long,
    But every step hums its own strong song.
    
    So lift your eyes, let doubts be small,
    The world is wide, you can take it all.
    Even the stars once hid from the night,
    Till someone dared to shine their light.
